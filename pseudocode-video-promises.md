Example1.
const promise = createOrder(cart);
promise.then(function (orderId){
proceedToPayment(orderId);
});

// usage of Promises in JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations.
// const promise = createOrder(cart);: This line declares a constant variable named promise and assigns it the result of calling the createOrder function with the cart parameter. The createOrder function returns a Promise object, which represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. The specifics of the createOrder function are not shown in the provided code snippet.
// promise.then(function (orderId) { ... });: The then() method is called on the promise object. This method takes in a callback function that will be executed when the promise is fulfilled, i.e., when the order creation is complete and a value (in this case, an orderId) is resolved. The then() method allows you to chain additional actions to be performed after the promise is fulfilled.
// function (orderId) { proceedToPayment(orderId); }: This is the callback function passed to the then() method. It takes the resolved orderId as a parameter. In this case, the function calls the proceedToPayment function, passing the orderId as a parameter. The specific implementation details of the proceedToPayment function are not shown in the provided code snippet.
// The code snippet demonstrates a promise chain where the createOrder function returns a promise, and once it is fulfilled (i.e., an orderId is resolved), the proceedToPayment function is called using the resolved orderId. This approach ensures that the proceedToPayment function is executed only after the order creation is complete. Promises provide a structured way to handle asynchronous operations and manage dependencies between different tasks.

Example2.
const cart = [“shoes”, “pants”, “kurta”]; 

createOrder(cart)
.then(function (orderId){
console.log(orderId);
return orderId;
})
.catch(function(err){
console.log(err.message);
})
.then(function(orderId){
return proceedToPayment (orderId);
})
.then(function(paymentInfo){
console.log(paymentInfo);
})
.catch(function(err){
console.log(err.message);
})
.then(function(orderId){
console.log(“No matter what happens, I will be called”);
})

// Producer

function createOrder(cart){
const pr = new promise(function(resolve, reject){
//createOrder
//validateCart
//orderId
if (!validateCart(cart)) {
const err = new Error(“Cart is not valid”);
reject(err); 
}
//logic for create order
const orderId = “1,2,3,4,5”;
if (orderId){
setTimeout(function(){
resolve(orderId); 
}, 5000);
}
}) ;
return pr;
}


function proceedToPayment(orderId) {
///
return new Promise (function(resolve, reject){
resolve (“Payment successful”);
});
}

function validateCart(cart) {
return true;
}

// if it is false the code is function validateCart(cart) {
//return false;
//}


// The given code demonstrates the use of promises in JavaScript to create an order, proceed to payment, and handle errors if any. Let's break down the code step by step:
// Initialize an array called cart with three items: "shoes", "pants", and "kurta".
// Call the createOrder function with the cart array. The createOrder function returns a promise.
// Use the then method on the returned promise to handle the fulfillment of the promise. In this case, a callback function is provided, which takes the orderId as an argument. Inside the callback, the orderId is logged to the console and then returned.
// Use the catch method to handle any errors that occur during the promise chain. The callback function takes an err argument and logs the error message to the console.
// Use the then method again to chain another promise. This time, the proceedToPayment function is called with the orderId as an argument. The proceedToPayment function returns a new promise.
// Use the then method to handle the fulfillment of the proceedToPayment promise. The callback function takes paymentInfo as an argument and logs it to the console.
// Use the catch method to handle any errors that occur during the proceedToPayment promise. The callback function logs the error message to the console.
// Use the then method again to chain another promise. This time, a callback function is provided, which takes orderId as an argument and logs a message to the console.
// The createOrder function is defined. It takes the cart array as an argument. Inside the function, a new promise (pr) is created using the Promise constructor.
// Within the promise, there is a check to validate the cart using the validateCart function. If the cart is not valid, an error is created with the message "Cart is not valid" and the promise is rejected with the error.
// If the cart is valid, the logic for creating the order is performed. In this example, a hardcoded orderId of "1,2,3,4,5" is assigned. Then, a setTimeout function is used to simulate an asynchronous operation that takes 5 seconds to complete. After the timeout, the promise is resolved with the orderId.
// The createOrder function returns the promise (pr).
// The proceedToPayment function is defined. It takes orderId as an argument. Inside the function, a new promise is created using the Promise constructor. The promise is immediately resolved with the string "Payment successful".
// The validateCart function is defined. It takes the cart array as an argument and returns true.
// In summary, the code demonstrates a promise-based flow where an order is created, validated, and then proceeds to payment. The code shows how to handle success and error scenarios using the then and catch methods of promises.
